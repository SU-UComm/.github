# Stanford Office of University Communications

[University Communications](https://ucomm.stanford.edu/) is the central resource for communications strategies
that advance and protect the reputation of Stanford University. We help Stanford influence and inspire a
changing world by broadly sharing discoveries, expertise, and ideas in compelling ways to multiple audiences.

University Communications manages institutional digital media, content strategy, leadership communications,
and media relations. We produce publications both internally and externally focused, including
[Stanford Report](https://news.stanford.edu/), as well as news and feature content for
[Stanford's main website](https://www.stanford.edu/). We also send a daily curated newsletter highlighting
transformational research and scholarship, campus news, and public events. Anyone is welcome to
